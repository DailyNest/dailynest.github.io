### **Steps to Push Your Own Articles to DailyNest**

---

### 1. **Fork and Clone the Repository**

First, you'll need to **fork** the DailyNest repository on GitHub. This creates your own copy of the project, where you can make changes.

1. Go to the [DailyNest GitHub repo](https://github.com/dailynest/dailynest.github.io) and click **Fork** (top-right).
2. Once forked, **clone** your repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dailynest.github.io.git
   cd dailynest.github.io

   ```

---

### 2. **Set Up the Development Environment**

Before you can start adding articles, you need to set up your local development environment:

1. **Create a `.env` file** in the root of your project and add:

   ```
   RUN_KEYSTATIC=true

   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   * If you’re using **npm**:

     ```
     npm install

     ```
   * Or if you prefer **bun**:

     ```
     bun install

     ```

---

### 3. **Run the Development Server**

To preview your articles locally, you’ll need to run the development server:

```
npm run dev

```

Or with **bun**:

```
bun dev

```

Visit [http://127.0.0.1:4321](http://127.0.0.1:4321/) to view your local instance.

   * **Slug**: URL-friendly version of the title (e.g., `getting-started-with-react`).
   * **Category**: Assign appropriate categories (e.g., `react`, `javascript`, `web development`).
   * **Published Time**: Date in ISO format (e.g., `2025-08-30T14:48:00.000Z`).

3. Add a description of your article and any relevant details.
4. Submit the **Pull Request** to the main DailyNest repository.
