PKM isn’t about hoarding highlights; it’s about turning what you consume into things you make. Keep your system boring and your ideas lively.

## The three C’s

- Capture: quickly save ideas and quotes with source links.
- Connect: link notes by concepts; write why the link matters.
- Create: draft posts, talks, or designs using your linked notes.

## A simple stack

- One notes app you trust (Obsidian, Notion, or plain Markdown).
- A fast capture method (hotkey, mobile share sheet, or email-in).
- A weekly review ritual to prune and stitch ideas.

## Practical patterns

- Templates for book notes, meeting notes, and project briefs.
- A map of content page listing your evergreen topics.
- Tags for people, projects, and statuses—not every noun.

## Keep it durable

- Prefer open formats. Backup to a folder you can zip.
- Write “why it matters” in your own words; don’t just paste.

Good PKM gets you from curiosity to output faster. Start small, keep links meaningful, and ship things with what you learn.
