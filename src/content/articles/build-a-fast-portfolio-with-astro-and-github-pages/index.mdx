You don’t need a JavaScript framework to ship a great personal site. Astro gives you a content-first workflow and ships almost no JS by default. This guide walks you from a blank folder to a live portfolio—fast.

## What you’ll build

- A clean, responsive one-page portfolio with About, Projects, and Contact sections
- A blog route powered by content collections
- Automated deployment to GitHub Pages

## Prerequisites

- Node 20+ or Bun
- A GitHub account

## 1) Create the project

Create a new Astro project and start the dev server. Accept defaults when prompted.

```bash
npm create astro@latest my-portfolio
cd my-portfolio
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:4321 to confirm it’s running.

## 2) Add a base layout

Create `src/layouts/base.astro` with a header, main, and footer. Keep typography simple. Add a global stylesheet in `src/styles/global.css` and import it once in your layout.

## 3) Build the home page sections

- About: a brief intro, a photo, and a CTA to your projects
- Projects: cards with title, description, tech, and links
- Contact: links to email and GitHub/LinkedIn

Use semantic HTML and minimal utility classes for readability.

## 4) Add a blog with content collections

Define an `articles` collection in `src/content.config.ts` with a schema for title, description, cover image, category, and published date. Put posts in `src/content/articles/<slug>/index.mdx`.

## 5) Make it look good (quick wins)

- Constrain content width to ~72ch for readability
- Use a serif display for headings and a clean sans for body
- Add dark mode with a class toggle; persist preference with localStorage

## 6) Ship to GitHub Pages

1. Create a new GitHub repo and push your code
2. In `astro.config.mjs`, set the `site` to your public URL
3. Add a GitHub Actions workflow or use your existing CI to build and deploy the `dist` folder to Pages

For a quick win, use the official docs to scaffold the Pages workflow. Ensure the branch and output folder are configured correctly.

## 7) Polish and iterate

- Add a Projects JSON or MDX list to keep content out of markup
- Create a `Card` component so new projects are easy to add
- Add Open Graph metadata to improve link previews
- Measure with Lighthouse and keep JS under control—Astro helps you here

## Troubleshooting

### My CSS isn’t loading on Pages

Check your `site` config and `base` path. Wrong values produce broken asset URLs in production.

### The blog index is empty

Validate frontmatter against your schema. Missing fields or invalid dates will exclude posts.

### Images look blurry

Prefer high-resolution sources and use `astro:assets` for local images. Set helpful `alt` text for accessibility and SEO.

## Where to go next

Add a contact form (serverless or static form service), integrate analytics, and write a “Now” page. Keep shipping small improvements every week—you’ll be miles ahead of most portfolios.
