Modern work is a marathon, not a sprint. You need fuel that’s steady, predictable, and kind to your brain. This isn’t about perfection—or a new diet with a name. It’s a simple system you can actually live with.

## The principle: stable blood sugar, steady energy

![Balanced plate: protein, whole grains, and colorful vegetables](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1504674900247-0877df9cc836?q=80&w=1200&auto=format&fit=crop)

Spikes and crashes torch focus. Build most meals around:

- Protein: 25–40g (eggs, fish, chicken, tofu, Greek yogurt, legumes)
- Fiber-rich carbs: oats, brown rice, whole wheat, beans, berries
- Healthy fats: olive oil, nuts, seeds, avocado
- Produce: 1–2 cups of colorful vegetables or fruit

A plate that balances these keeps you full 3–5 hours and makes your next decision easier.

## Breakfast that carries you to lunch

- Greek yogurt bowl: 1 cup Greek yogurt, berries, 1 tbsp chia, 1 tbsp almonds, drizzle of honey
- Oats power bowl: 1/2 cup oats, 1 scoop whey/pea protein, 1 banana, cinnamon, peanut butter
- Eggs + greens: 2–3 eggs, sautéed spinach, whole-grain toast, olive oil

Aim for 25–35g protein and 8–12g fiber. Coffee is fine—drink water first.

## Lunch that doesn’t crash you at 3pm

- Grain bowl: quinoa or brown rice, roasted veg, chicken/tofu, tahini
- Wrap: whole-grain wrap, hummus, tuna/chicken, mixed greens, pickled veg
- Leftover strategy: cook double at dinner, pack a container immediately

Pro tip: sauces make it repeatable. Stock tahini, salsa, mustard, pesto, and chili crisp.

## Snacks that feel like a bridge, not a cliff

Think “protein + fiber” in ~150–250 kcal:

- Apple + 1–2 tbsp peanut butter
- Handful of nuts + a fruit
- 2 rice cakes + cottage cheese
- Protein shake + a few berries

## Hydration without overthinking it

- Start the day with 300–500ml water
- Keep a 600–800ml bottle at your desk; finish 2–3 by dinner
- Tea counts; sugary drinks don’t help focus

## Dinner that restores you, not knocks you out

- 1–2 palms protein, 1–2 fists plants, 1–2 cupped hands carbs, 1–2 thumbs fats
- If evenings are sedating you, lower starchy carbs and increase veggies + lean protein

## Weekend prep in 60 minutes

![Meal prep trays with roasted vegetables and grains](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1504674900247-0877df9cc836?q=80&w=1200&auto=format&fit=crop)

You’re not cooking all week—just creating defaults:

1. Roast a tray: broccoli, peppers, carrots, onions, zucchini (olive oil, salt, pepper)
2. Cook a grain: rice/quinoa/barley
3. Make a protein: baked chicken thighs, chickpeas, tofu
4. Prep sauces: lemon-tahini and salsa verde
5. Stock snacks: Greek yogurt, nuts, fruit, hummus, carrots

Now weekday you opens the fridge and assembles in five minutes.

## Timing: when to eat around deep work

- 60–90 minutes before a deep-work block: small snack (protein + fruit)
- After a long session: balanced meal to restock glycogen and calm the nervous system
- Late-night work? Choose lighter foods; avoid heavy, greasy meals that wreck sleep

## Caffeine that helps vs. hurts

- Delay the first coffee 60–90 minutes after waking (let cortisol peak)
- 200–300mg total/day max for most adults; taper by 2 pm if sleep matters (it does)
- If you get jittery: smaller, more frequent doses; match with food

## Eating out without blowing the day

![Balanced restaurant meal: salad and lean protein](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1478145046317-39f10e56b5e9?q=80&w=1200&auto=format&fit=crop)

Scan the menu for protein + fiber first; ask for veg swaps; dressings on the side. A burger with extra salad can be a great choice if you skip the second bun and fries.

## Troubleshooting common problems

### “I’m starving at 4 pm.”

![Afternoon snack: yogurt and berries](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1505250469679-203ad9ced0cb?q=80&w=1200&auto=format&fit=crop)

Add 10–15g protein and 5–8g fiber at lunch; add a mid-afternoon snack. Check water.

### “I overeat at dinner.”

Eat a real lunch. Front-load protein earlier. Don’t arrive home at 9/10 hunger.

### “Weekends undo everything.”

Keep breakfast the same every day. Plan one anchor meal you look forward to. Walk more.

## A simple 7-day template

![Weekly meal planning: notes and grocery bags](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1490645935967-10de6ba17061?q=80&w=1200&auto=format&fit=crop)

Mon–Fri breakfasts repeat; lunches are bowls/wraps; dinners rotate protein + veg + carb; Saturday brunch + social dinner; Sunday prep + lighter dinner.

## Grocery list (print this)

- Protein: eggs, chicken thighs, tuna, Greek yogurt, tofu, chickpeas
- Carbs: oats, rice/quinoa, whole-grain wraps, potatoes, beans
- Fats: olive oil, nuts, seeds, peanut butter
- Produce: spinach, tomatoes, peppers, onions, carrots, berries, apples, lemons
- Flavor: garlic, tahini, mustard, salsa, chili crisp, herbs

## Two 15-minute dinners

1. Lemon-garlic chickpeas: olive oil, garlic, chickpeas, spinach, lemon, salt; serve over rice
2. Sheet-pan salmon: salmon, broccoli, olive oil, salt, pepper; 450°F/230°C for ~12–15 min

## Progress over perfection

You don’t need new rules; you need reliable defaults. Build three breakfasts, three lunches, and five dinners you can repeat without thinking. That’s how energy gets sustainable.

### FAQ

#### Do supplements matter?

Food first. A basic multivitamin can help fill gaps; protein powder is just convenient protein. Creatine (3–5g/day) may support cognition and training in many adults. Talk to your clinician if you have conditions or take medications.

#### What about intermittent fasting?

It works for some people’s schedule and appetite; it’s not magic. Prioritize protein and plants either way. If fasting triggers binges, it’s a sign to adjust.

#### How do I eat well with kids and a busy job?

Batch one thing per week (protein, a roasted veg, or a grain). Use frozen veg. Keep fruit visible. Default to simple meals and repeat them without guilt.
