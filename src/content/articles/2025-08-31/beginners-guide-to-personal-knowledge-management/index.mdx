Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) is about building a **second brain**—a trusted system where your notes, ideas, and references live so you can use them later.  
Unlike bookmarking everything and forgetting it, PKM helps you **capture, connect, and create** knowledge that compounds over time.

## Why PKM matters

In the age of information overload, we consume far more than we remember. Articles, podcasts, videos, and conversations disappear unless we actively **process them into knowledge**.  
A good PKM system ensures your ideas don’t vanish and instead fuel your learning, projects, and creativity.

## The Three C’s of PKM

1. **Capture**  
   Quickly save ideas, quotes, highlights, or insights. Add context (why it matters, where you found it) so it isn’t just a dead fragment.

2. **Connect**  
   Link notes together by themes or concepts. For example, connect a book quote on creativity to your project notes on design. Always add a sentence about _why the link exists_.

3. **Create**  
   Use your network of notes to make something new: blog posts, videos, talks, strategies, or personal decisions.  
   PKM isn’t about stockpiling—it’s about shipping.

## A simple PKM setup

You don’t need a complicated system or dozens of apps. Start small:

- **One notes app you trust** → Obsidian, Logseq, Notion, or plain Markdown.
- **A fast capture method** → Hotkeys, mobile quick-capture, or even emailing yourself.
- **A weekly review** → Spend 30 minutes tidying notes, merging duplicates, and stitching connections.

## Practical workflows

- **Templates** → Standardize how you capture book notes, meeting notes, or project briefs.
- **Maps of Content (MOCs)** → Create hub pages listing your key topics like productivity, health, or design.
- **Purposeful tags** → Use tags for people, projects, or statuses (`#status/in-progress`), not every word.

## Keep it durable

Your system should last years, not months. To make it future-proof:

- Prefer **open formats** like Markdown or plain text.
- **Back up regularly** (cloud or local).
- Always write in **your own words**—summaries beat copy-paste highlights.

## Leveling up your PKM

Once you’re comfortable, you can explore advanced methods:

- **Zettelkasten** → Atomic notes with unique IDs linked into a knowledge web.
- **Progressive summarization** → Layered highlights (bold, summaries, takeaways) to resurface key insights.
- **Idea pipelines** → Track notes as they move from raw capture → refined → draft → published.

## The payoff

PKM helps you:

- Remember what you learn.
- Spot hidden connections.
- Turn curiosity into output faster.

It’s not about flashy tools or endless tagging—it’s about creating a **living knowledge system** that supports your projects, career, and creativity.
