Big transformations usually start with small, repeatable steps. Habits stick when they’re obvious, easy, and satisfying.

## Make it obvious

Use visual cues: put your book on the pillow, your running shoes by the door, or your TODO list on your keyboard. Your environment should invite the behavior you want.

## Make it easy

Shrink the first step to two minutes or less. Open the editor, write one sentence, stretch for 30 seconds. Momentum beats motivation.

## Make it satisfying

Track streaks in a simple calendar. Reward consistency with small wins, not cheat days. If you miss a day, bounce back the next day—never miss twice.

## Layer habits with stacking

Attach the new behavior to an existing routine: “After I make coffee, I plan my top task.” Over time, the pair becomes automatic.
