If users feel your site before they see it, you’ve already lost them. In 2025, real-world performance is about eliminating wasted work, prioritizing the obvious wins, and measuring in production—not chasing a perfect Lighthouse score.

## What actually matters now

- Core Web Vitals: LCP, CLS, INP. Fast pixels, stable layout, responsive interactions.
- Time to usable: quick render of the useful above-the-fold stuff beats loading everything perfectly.
- Consistency: steady p75 across devices and regions, not just your dev laptop.

## Set a performance budget

- JavaScript: aim for < 150 KB gzipped on critical routes.
- Images: < 200 KB above the fold; defer the rest. Prefer AVIF/WEBP.
- Fonts: 1–2 families, 2 weights max; preload critical; use `font-display: swap`.

## Images: the easiest big win

- Generate responsive sources and correct sizes. Serve modern formats with fallbacks.
- Lazy-load everything below the fold; mark hero image as `fetchpriority="high"` and `decoding="async"`.
- Provide accurate `alt` text. It helps SEO and accessibility.

## CSS: keep it simple

- Inline minimal critical CSS. Defer everything else.
- Purge unused styles. Avoid heavy runtime CSS-in-JS for static content.

## JavaScript: the real diet

- Ship islands of interactivity, not an entire SPA by default.
- Split vendor code, defer non-essential scripts, and prefer native browser features.
- Audit dependencies quarterly. If a library does one small thing, use a utility or write it.

## Fonts without the jank

- Preload your primary text font, limit variants, and avoid FOIT by using `swap`.
- Consider system fonts for UI; custom fonts for headings only.

## Network and caching

- Cache aggressively at the edge. Immutable assets with content hashes; short TTL for HTML.
- Use `stale-while-revalidate` to keep pages snappy during deploys.

## Monitor in production

- Collect RUM data: LCP, CLS, INP, and route-level page weight.
- Segment by device, network, and geography. Optimize for your audience.

## Checklists you can actually use

- Before merging: run a quick Lighthouse and bundle size check on the PR.
- Before deploy: p75 vitals from staging or canary traffic.
- After deploy: diff p75 against last release and alert on regressions.

Performance is a mindset, not a one-off sprint. Budget it, measure it, and keep the surface area small so you can move fast without breaking the experience.
