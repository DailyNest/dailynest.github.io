Remote work can be sustainable and energizing—if your days have rhythm. The goal is not perfection; it’s a small set of rituals that keep you moving.

## Morning primer (30 minutes)

- Wake window at the same time daily; natural light within 30 minutes.
- Movement snack: 5–10 minutes of mobility or a short walk.
- Plan your top one or two outcomes before checking messages.

## Focus blocks and breaks

- Two 60–90 minute focus blocks before lunch if possible; breaks with movement and water.
- Use a single-screen, single-window mode for focus; close chat unless you’re on-call.

## Boundaries that hold

- A visual “work off” signal: close the laptop, dim the lamp, or put your notebook away.
- A 10–15 minute shutdown routine: list wins, plan tomorrow, and pick a non-work activity.

## Ergonomics without the pain

- Chair height for 90-degree knees; elbows at desk height; screen top at eye level.
- Alternate between sitting and standing; micro-break every 30–45 minutes.

## Social and mental health

- Schedule weekly 1:1s with teammates and one virtual coffee.
- A hobby you do offline three times per week—reading, cooking, music.

## Checklist to audit your week

- Did you hit your focus blocks 3–4 days?
- Did you move daily and get morning light on most days?
- Did your shutdown routine happen 4–5 days?

Small, consistent inputs beat sporadic overhauls. Design your environment for the behaviors you want, then let the routines carry you.
