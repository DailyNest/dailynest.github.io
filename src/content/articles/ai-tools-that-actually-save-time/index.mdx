The best AI tools feel invisible. They shorten the distance between intent and output, and they let you stay in flow. The rest are demos.

## Writing: from draft to publish faster

- Draft expansion helps you break writer’s block—start with bullet points, then expand.
- Structural edits (headings, transitions, tone) save rounds of revision.
- Source-linked summaries let you verify claims and keep citations tight.

## Coding: speed without breaking things

- Context-aware completions accelerate routine code while preserving your style.
- Inline doc generation nudges you to keep APIs discoverable.
- Test scaffolding lowers the activation energy to write unit tests—then you fill in edge cases.

## Research: compress the haystack

- Semantic search finds the right paragraph, not just the right page.
- Automatic outline builders give you a map before you dive into the details.
- Fact-checking workflows keep you honest—always verify with the primary source.

Adopt tools that integrate where you already work. Start with one pain point, measure the time saved for two weeks, and keep only what earns its keep.

## Buyer’s checklist: choose once, cry never

- Proven latency under load (p95 < 800ms for core actions)
- Transparent pricing with usage caps and alerts
- Native integrations for your editor, docs, and chat tools
- Private mode or self-host options for sensitive data
- Exportability: can you get your prompts, docs, and chat history out?

## Privacy, data, and compliance

- Redaction: scrub secrets before they hit an API (tokens, keys, PII)
- Retention: confirm how long providers store prompts/outputs
- SOC2/ISO 27001: helpful, but not a substitute for least privilege
- Access control: SSO, SCIM, and audit logs at a minimum

## How to evaluate in one week

Day 1: baseline your current time on a repeatable task. Day 2–4: run the tool in parallel on the same tasks. Day 5: measure time saved, quality deltas, rework, and interruptions. Keep if net-positive; otherwise, uninstall.

## Patterns that compound

- Saved prompts library for recurring work (code reviews, PR templates, bug triage)
- Style guides for writing and code ensure outputs match your voice
- Small automations (snippets, slash-commands) wired to your workflows
