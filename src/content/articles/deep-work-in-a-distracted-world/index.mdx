Shallow tasks aren’t evil—they’re unbounded. If you let them, they’ll swallow your day. Deep work shifts the center of gravity back to high-impact creation.

## The mechanics of distraction

Notifications are variable rewards; they train you to seek novelty. Every micro-interruption incurs a switching cost as your brain reloads context. Protect your RAM by batch-processing low-value items.

## The deep work protocol

1. Choose one important, well-defined outcome for today.
2. Block 90 minutes—phone out of the room, email closed, one window only.
3. Write a short intention: “For the next block, I will produce X by doing Y.”
4. When you drift, notice without judgment, and gently return to the task.

## Environmental design

Make focus the default: a tidy desk, a single monitor with a maximized window, and a keyboard shortcut to disable notifications. Reduce decision fatigue by planning your first block the day before.

## Sustain the habit

End each session by writing one sentence about what’s next. That breadcrumb lowers the friction to start tomorrow. Track your focused hours weekly and celebrate streaks—not perfection.
