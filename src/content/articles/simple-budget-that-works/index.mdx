Most budgets fail due to friction and complexity. The antidote is a high-level plan that’s easy to maintain and resilient to surprises.

## The 60/20/20 baseline

- 60% Needs: rent, utilities, groceries, transport.
- 20% Wants: entertainment, restaurants, hobbies.
- 20% Future: savings, investments, and extra debt payments.

This is a starting point—adjust to your reality (e.g., high-rent cities) without guilt.

## Weekly check-in (15 minutes)

Categorize new transactions, confirm upcoming bills, and adjust if you overspent in one area by borrowing from a discretionary category. Keep it flexible.

## Friction reducers

Automate savings on payday. Use separate accounts for bills and spending to avoid surprises. Review subscriptions quarterly.
